### Air India Crash Triggers 20% Drop in Bookings and 15% Fare Dip Across Routes

The aviation industry is facing turbulent skies after the tragic **Air India crash** on **June 12, 2025**, which resulted in the loss of over **270 lives**. In the aftermath of this devastating incident, both **domestic and international travel sectors** have seen a notable shift in passenger behavior.

### The Incident: A Nation in Shock

Air India’s flight **AI-171**, operating a **Boeing 787 Dreamliner**, crashed into a residential neighborhood in **Meghaninagar, Ahmedabad** shortly after takeoff. The flight was carrying **242 passengers and crew members**, and tragically, only **one survivor** emerged.

#### Immediate Consequences

- The crash led to **nationwide mourning**.
- Air India's safety protocols and aircraft maintenance practices came under scrutiny.
- Public sentiment has understandably shifted toward **travel apprehension** with the carrier.

### Travel Industry Reacts

According to **Ravi Gosain**, President of the **Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO)**:

> “We have observed a temporary decline in bookings, particularly on international sectors… around 18–22% internationally and 10–12% domestically.”

This sentiment-driven reaction appears to be a **short-term response**, likely to stabilize once confidence is rebuilt.

### Fare Adjustments Across Routes

In an effort to revive demand and adapt to lowered passenger volumes, **Air India has adjusted fares downward**.

| Route Type        | Fare Reduction Range |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Domestic Routes   | 8% – 12%             |
| International Routes | 10% – 15%         |

The reduction is largely influenced by **competition with low-cost carriers** like **IndiGo** and **Akasa**, especially on **Europe and Southeast Asia routes**.

> “These reductions are a mix of promotional strategies and yield correction,” Gosain told PTI.

### Booking Cancellations Spike

Gosain also revealed that the crash has led to **a rise in cancellations**:

- **International cancellations**: up **15% – 18%**
- **Domestic cancellations**: up **8% – 10%**

Most of these cancellations are from **corporate and high-end leisure travelers**, who have chosen to shift to **alternative carriers** with perceived stronger safety records.

### Industry Insights from FAITH

**Rajiv Mehra**, General Secretary of the **Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism & Hospitality (FAITH)**, corroborated IATO’s findings:

> “As far as Air India is concerned, fares are around 10% cheaper for both domestic and international routes than other airlines on certain sectors.”

He also highlighted a **15% – 20% drop in new bookings** for the carrier post-crash. Mehra called on all airlines to prioritize **aircraft maintenance and safety standards** to restore traveler trust.

### Public Sentiment & Passenger Behavior

The crash has also affected **traveler sentiment**, with a sudden **surge in demand for emergency exit seats** on flights, particularly those labeled **“11A”**, which were linked to survivor seats in the crash.

This behavior underscores how **psychological safety perceptions** now influence ticket booking more than ever.

### Air India’s Silence

Notably, **Air India has not issued an official statement** responding to the fall in bookings or fares. While **Air India CEO** previously claimed the crashed aircraft was **“well-maintained,”** the airline has yet to reassure customers with a broader strategic safety communication plan.

### What Lies Ahead?

While bookings are currently down, experts suggest this could be **a temporary blip**. Historically, airline crashes often lead to short-term dips in revenue and bookings, but brands recover over time with **transparent communication**, **renewed safety measures**, and **public outreach**.

However, whether Air India can **rebuild its brand trust** in a competitive market will depend heavily on:

- **Safety audits and third-party validation**
- **Visible changes in operational protocols**
- **Open communication with passengers**
- **Proactive media engagement**

### A Call for Stringent Safety Oversight

This crash has once again put the spotlight on **aviation regulators**, particularly the **Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)**. While DGCA has reaffirmed **Air India’s compliance with global safety standards**, public pressure is mounting for:

- **More frequent safety inspections**
- **Stricter maintenance reporting**
- **Transparency on aircraft age and flight hours**

### Final Thoughts

This tragic crash has reminded the world of the **fragile balance between aviation convenience and safety**. It is a wake-up call not just for Air India but for all carriers to **reassess safety commitments**, **crisis communication protocols**, and **passenger care strategies**.

In a competitive market driven by **public trust**, airlines must go beyond regulatory compliance and **build emotional assurance** for travelers.
