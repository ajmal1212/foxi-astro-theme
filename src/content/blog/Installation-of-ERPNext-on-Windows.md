### Install ERPNext on Windows using VirtualBox, Ubuntu Server, and port forwarding.

Since the Frappe framework is itself open-source, it supports only Linux OS. But we all might not use Linux as the Host operating system, which discourages learners from starting with it.

Before starting with installation, let us understand what ERP is and its use cases.

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are used by organizations to streamline and integrate various business processes across departments and functions. Here are some common reasons why ERP is used:

Centralized Data Management: ERP systems provide a central database that allows for the storage, management, and retrieval of data from various business functions. This eliminates data duplication, improves data accuracy, and provides real-time access to information for decision-making.

Process Automation: ERP systems automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks such as data entry, inventory management, financial processes, and reporting. By automating these processes, organizations can increase efficiency, reduce errors, and free up employees’ time for more value-added activities.

Streamlined Operations: ERP systems integrate various business functions such as finance, human resources, procurement, inventory management, sales, and customer relationship management. By consolidating these functions into a unified system, organizations can streamline their operations, eliminate silos, and improve overall efficiency.

Data Visibility and Reporting: ERP systems provide real-time visibility into key business metrics and performance indicators. This allows managers and executives to monitor the organization’s performance, make data-driven decisions, and generate comprehensive reports for analysis and planning.

So, one of the challenging parts is its installation. Since the frappe frame is itself open-source, it supports only the Linux OS. But we all might not use Linux as the Host operating system, which discourages learners from starting with it.
